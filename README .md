# 🐳 Docker Labs Repository

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a collection of Docker-based mini projects and practice labs created to learn and experiment with containerization, networking, and DevOps concepts.

Each folder in this repository represents an independent project — fully containerized and easy to run using Docker Compose.

## 🧩 Projects Included

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Weather Project 🌦️** | A full-stack weather dashboard using Node.js (backend) and NGINX (frontend). Fetches real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API. |
| **Medical Appointment 💊** | A containerized web app for booking medical appointments. Includes backend (Node.js + MySQL) and frontend served by NGINX. |

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Docker & Docker Compose 🐳
- Node.js & Express.js 🚀
- MySQL Database 🗄️
- NGINX Reverse Proxy 🌐
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript 💻

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This repo is part of my DevOps practice journey — focusing on:

- Building and containerizing Node.js applications
- Managing multi-container environments with Docker Compose
- Using environment variables and `.env` files securely
- Implementing NGINX as a reverse proxy
- Linking backend APIs with frontend web apps

## 💡 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohanadHesham98/Docker-labs.git
cd Docker-labs
```

2. Navigate to any project folder:

```bash
cd weather-project
```

3. Run it using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. Open your browser and test the running app (usually on `http://localhost`).
